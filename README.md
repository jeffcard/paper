Investigated in this paper is Age of Information (AoI), a key timeliness metric for sensor data. Various scheduling policies aim to optimize AoI, but improving them with prediction and determining the required predictive packets remain crucial questions. We propose that long packet sequences can be segmented into local epochs with an invariant global optimal policy. This perspective sheds light on counter-intuitive results, such as idle waiting outperforming immediate updates. Our findings demonstrate that predictive scheduling outperforms other policies in AoI optimization.
